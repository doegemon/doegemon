## Hello, World!

My name is Nicolas, and I currently work as a Analytics Engineer, developing analyses through data collection and programming tools such as Python and SQL, always aiming to solve business problems and generate insights for the data and business team. 

As a professional, I prioritize fast delivery and quality data-based analysis. I am practical in solving business problems, but always with a theoretical basis.

## Main Projects:
### CRUD + API - Product Catalog Management
Basic CRUD project to test my knowledge of Python, SQL, APIs and Docker, aiming to modernize the way a small company manages their product catalog, by having a website or platform where the user can view, add, delete or update a product.

The objectives of this project were:
- Structure the database backend to support these operations, using Python, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic and FastAPI.
- Create a frontend application to perform operations on the database, using Streamlit and Requests
- Configure the Docker files to guarantee the integrity of the solution/application on other devices and operating systems.

### Sales forecast for the Rossmann pharmacy chain
Data science project using Machine Learning with the aim of predicting the value of sales at Rossmann pharmacies over the next 6 weeks. The model adopted predicted a baseline scenario with consolidated gross revenue of €281.1M for the next 6 weeks. In the worst-case scenario, consolidated gross revenue will be €280.1M, and in the best-case scenario, €282M. 

It was developed using Python, the Random Forest and XGBoost algorithms and visualization takes place via a bot on Telegram.

### Sorting and classifying customers to cross-sell a new product
Data science project using Machine Learning with the aim of sorting a list of customers by their propensity to purchase a new product from an insurance company. The model adopted ordered the customer list in such a way that the first 20,000 customers comprise approximately 70% of the customers interested in purchasing the new product, representing a performance approximately 3 times better than offering the product to customers at random (demonstrated by the Lift Curve).

It was developed using Python, KNN, Extra Trees, Random Forest, LGBM and XGBoost algorithms. The ordered list is visualized by applying the model to a Google Sheets spreadsheet.
