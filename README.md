## Hello, World!

My name is Nicolas, and I currently work as a Analytics Engineer, developing analyses through data collection and programming tools such as Python and SQL, always aiming to solve business problems and generate insights for the data and business team. 

As a professional, I prioritize fast delivery and quality data-based analysis. I am practical in solving business problems, but always with a theoretical basis.

## Main Projects:
### CRUD + API - Product Catalog Management
Basic CRUD project to test my knowledge of Python, SQL, APIs and Docker, aiming to modernize the way a small company manages their product catalog, by having a website or platform where the user can view, add, delete or update a product.

The objectives of this project were:
- Structure the database backend to support these operations, using Python, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic and FastAPI.
- Create a frontend application to perform operations on the database, using Streamlit and Requests
- Configure the Docker files to guarantee the integrity of the solution/application on other devices and operating systems.

### SQL + dbt - Manipulating a Database
Despite having a well-structured database, a fictious company would like to modernize this base, ensuring harmonized data handling and good data quality, as well as having the data ready for use in analyses and reports.

The main objectives were:
- Use Docker to create a PostgreSQL database without the need to install PostgreSQL + pgAdmin locally
- Use dbt Core to manipulate the database, creating different data layers (staging, intermediate, and mart) with properly formatted models ready for use in analyses and reports
